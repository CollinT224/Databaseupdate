            "[10:55.620 --> 11:00.740]  That became one of the largest investigations in the department's history.\n",

            "[11:32.940 --> 11:36.580]  Why do these prosecutions mean so much to you?\n",
            "[11:36.580 --> 11:39.460]  Because this is a fundamental aspect of our democracy.\n",
            "[11:39.460 --> 11:45.180]  If we can't ensure that this kind of behavior doesn't recur, it will occur.\n",
            "[11:45.180 --> 11:50.020]  The prosecutions we bring are deterrence against that from happening.\n",

            "[03:50.140 --> 03:53.060]  It's an incredibly difficult life.\n",
            "[03:53.060 --> 03:54.260]  But is it worth it?\n",
            "[03:54.260 --> 03:56.420]  Look around you.\n",
            "[03:56.420 --> 03:58.380]  Ask yourself the question.\n",
            "[03:58.380 --> 04:01.540]  For me, I've answered it many times over and that's why I stay in uniform and that's why\n",

            "[04:33.020 --> 04:38.700]  Perhaps more than any other chairman in the role you have become ensnarled in politics\n",
            "[04:38.700 --> 04:41.260]  and, arguably, threats to the Constitution.\n",
            "[04:41.260 --> 04:43.740]  What have you learned from that?\n",
            "[04:43.740 --> 04:47.780]  I think it's important to keep your North Star, which is the Constitution.\n",

            "[04:58.340 --> 05:04.300]  I realized that I stepped into a political minefield and I shouldn't have.\n",

            "[05:49.260 --> 05:53.700]  As a commissioned, uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from.\n",
            "[05:53.700 --> 05:56.220]  It's rare for a chairman to apologize publicly.\n",
            "[05:56.620 --> 05:58.580]  Well, you know, I grew up here in Boston.\n",

            "[06:09.540 --> 06:12.980]  After you apologized, former President Trump said you choked like a dog.\n",
            "[06:12.980 --> 06:18.780]  Yeah, I'm not going to comment on anything the former president has said or not said.\n",
            "[06:18.780 --> 06:24.060]  General Milley did tell us he was so disillusioned with the former president's actions, he nearly\n",
            "[06:24.060 --> 06:25.060]  resigned.\n",
            "[06:25.140 --> 06:30.420]  Instead, according to former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, he and the general made a pact\n",
            "[06:30.420 --> 06:35.540]  to protect the military from becoming politicized or misused.\n",
            "[06:35.540 --> 06:41.580]  It's also been reported that you spent several days, several drafts of resignation letters.\n",
            "[06:41.580 --> 06:46.580]  I was very struck by the one that was published in which you said to the president, it is\n",

            "[07:53.620 --> 07:59.100]  To say that the commander in chief, Donald Trump, was ruining the international order\n",
            "[07:59.100 --> 08:04.620]  and causing significant damage, what did you see that caused you to write that?\n",
            "[08:04.620 --> 08:05.620]  I would say that-\n",
            "[08:05.620 --> 08:08.140]  It's got to be more than walking into Lafayette Square in uniform.\n",
            "[08:08.140 --> 08:11.580]  There was a wide variety of initiatives that were ongoing.\n",
            "[08:11.580 --> 08:14.380]  One of them, of course, was withdrawing troops out of NATO.\n",
            "[08:14.380 --> 08:20.700]  Those were initiatives that placed at risk, you know, I think, America's role in the world.\n",
            "[08:20.700 --> 08:27.700]  Now, that is the opposite of what my parents and 18 million others wore in the uniform\n",

            "[09:04.320 --> 09:09.540]  And interesting, no officers, these were all 100% enlisted and they had their own opinions\n",
            "[09:09.540 --> 09:11.040]  of officers too.\n",
            "[09:11.040 --> 09:12.040]  Including your parents, right?\n",

            "[09:41.240 --> 09:47.320]  And took a particular interest in a few of the young officers whose language skills are\n",
            "[09:47.320 --> 09:49.480]  currently in high demand.\n",
            "[09:49.480 --> 09:51.000]  I speak Chinese, sir.\n",
            "[09:51.000 --> 09:52.400]  Chinese is really, really important to us.\n",

            "[10:04.100 --> 10:09.260]  We, the United States, need to take the challenge, the military challenge of China extraordinarily\n",
            "[10:09.260 --> 10:10.260]  seriously.\n",
            "[10:10.260 --> 10:16.220]  How concerned are you that military-to-military communications are not happening right now\n",
            "[10:16.220 --> 10:17.220]  with China?\n",
            "[10:17.220 --> 10:19.540]  Yeah, I think we need to get that established.\n",
            "[10:19.540 --> 10:21.900]  We had them for a period of time and then they've dropped off.\n",
            "[10:21.900 --> 10:26.580]  So channels of communication are important in order to de-escalate in time of crisis.\n",
            "[10:26.580 --> 10:32.020]  General Milley says he held a total of five calls with his Chinese military counterparts\n",
            "[10:32.020 --> 10:34.980]  during the Trump and Biden administrations.\n",
            "[10:34.980 --> 10:39.780]  But it was his last two calls during the final months of the Trump presidency that got the\n",
            "[10:39.780 --> 10:44.760]  attention of the press, Congress and the former president himself.\n",
            "[10:44.760 --> 10:50.300]  Why did you think it was so important to call your Chinese military counterpart in the aftermath\n",
            "[10:50.300 --> 10:51.980]  of the January 6 attacks?\n",
            "[10:51.980 --> 10:53.620]  That's an example of de-escalation.\n",
            "[10:53.620 --> 10:59.500]  So there was clear indications that the Chinese were very concerned about what they were observing\n",
            "[10:59.500 --> 11:00.500]  here in the United States.\n",
            "[11:00.500 --> 11:03.660]  Did you see some movement of Chinese military equipment?\n",
            "[11:03.660 --> 11:05.580]  I won't go over anything classified.\n",
            "[11:05.580 --> 11:10.780]  So I won't discuss exactly what we saw or didn't see or what we heard or didn't hear.\n",
            "[11:10.780 --> 11:15.820]  I will just say that there was clear indications that the Chinese are very concerned.\n",
            "[11:15.820 --> 11:20.560]  President Trump recently said that your dealings with China were so egregious that in times\n",
            "[11:20.560 --> 11:24.240]  gone by, the punishment would have been death.\n",
            "[11:24.240 --> 11:29.080]  That's right, he said that.\n",
            "[11:29.080 --> 11:33.120]  But for the record, was there anything inappropriate or treasonous about the calls you made to\n",
            "[11:33.120 --> 11:34.120]  China?\n",
            "[11:34.120 --> 11:35.120]  Absolutely not.\n",
            "[11:35.120 --> 11:36.120]  Zero.\n",
            "[11:36.120 --> 11:37.120]  None.\n",

            "[11:38.120 --> 11:39.120]  Congress knows that.\n",
            "[11:39.120 --> 11:41.320]  We've answered these questions several different times in writing.\n",
            "[11:41.320 --> 11:45.680]  Were you giving the Chinese information about thinking of the president of the United States?\n",
            "[11:45.680 --> 11:50.400]  The specific conversation was, I think, in accordance with the intent of the secretary\n",
            "[11:50.400 --> 11:54.360]  of defense, which was to make sure the Chinese knew that we were not going to attack them.\n",
            "[11:54.360 --> 11:58.560]  Why did the Chinese think that the U.S. under then President Trump was going to attack them?\n",
            "[11:58.560 --> 12:03.760]  The Chinese were concerned about what is commonly referred to in the English language like an\n",
            "[12:03.760 --> 12:06.960]  October surprise, wag the dog sort of thing.\n",
            "[12:06.960 --> 12:07.960]  They were wrong.\n",
            "[12:07.960 --> 12:09.480]  They were not reading us right.\n",
            "[12:09.480 --> 12:14.240]  Look at, President Trump was not going to attack China, and they needed to know that.\n",
            "[12:14.240 --> 12:19.760]  China, Russia, and the war in Ukraine are now the problem of his successor.\n",
            "[12:19.760 --> 12:24.160]  Air Force General Charles Q. Brown Jr.\n",
            "[12:24.160 --> 12:27.720]  There are also areas of concern closer to home.\n",
            "[12:27.720 --> 12:34.080]  Last year, the Army missed its recruiting numbers by 15,000 soldiers, the worst shortfall\n",
            "[12:34.080 --> 12:35.800]  in decades.\n",
            "[12:35.800 --> 12:39.680]  Confidence in the U.S. military is at its lowest in two decades.\n",
            "[12:39.680 --> 12:42.560]  Do you bear any personal responsibility for that?\n",
            "[12:42.560 --> 12:43.560]  Absolutely.\n",
            "[12:43.560 --> 12:47.240]  I think as the leader of the military, the uniformed military, I think that I am part\n",
            "[12:47.240 --> 12:48.240]  of that for sure.\n",
            "[12:48.240 --> 12:53.080]  I think the walk from the White House to the St. John Church, I think that helped create\n",
            "[12:53.080 --> 12:54.080]  some of that.\n",
            "[12:54.080 --> 12:57.000]  I think the withdrawal from Afghanistan helped create some of that.\n",
            "[12:57.000 --> 13:01.480]  But I would also say the United States military is still one of the most respected institutions\n",

            "[05:46.080 --> 05:47.080]  I called the St. Regis.\n",
            "[05:47.080 --> 05:50.600]  I asked for Salvador Dali's room, and they put me through.\n",
            "[05:51.200 --> 05:55.400]  I was quite nervous, but I told him I was a fan and that I would enjoy very much to\n",

            "[05:56.880 --> 06:01.600]  He said, can you come to New York this weekend on Saturday?\n",
            "[06:01.600 --> 06:02.600]  I said yes.\n",
            "[06:02.600 --> 06:07.520]  He said, be in the lobby at 12 o'clock, and I'll meet you then.\n",
            "[06:07.520 --> 06:08.720]  He was spectacular.\n",
            "[06:08.720 --> 06:13.360]  It would never have occurred to me to just call Salvador Dali in his hotel room.\n",
            "[06:13.360 --> 06:16.240]  I had nothing to lose.\n",
            "[06:16.240 --> 06:20.720]  Salvador Dali spent the afternoon together, and at the end of it, he asked the world-renowned\n",
            "[06:20.720 --> 06:23.200]  artist to pose for this picture.\n",
            "[06:23.200 --> 06:29.080]  I remember he put his mustache up and he was telling me, you know, kid, hurry up.\n",
            "[06:29.080 --> 06:31.340]  I can't hold this pose all day.\n",
            "[06:31.340 --> 06:36.980]  But I left New York that evening feeling like I could do this.\n",
            "[06:36.980 --> 06:41.120]  After finishing school, he hitchhiked to New York and started making art in his Lower East\n",
            "[06:41.120 --> 06:46.360]  Side apartment, buying cheap plastic inflatables and putting them on mirrors.\n",
            "[06:46.360 --> 06:50.640]  Coons had grand ambitions, but he needed cash to realize them.\n",
            "[06:50.640 --> 06:56.640]  So eventually I became licensed and registered to sell commodities and mutual funds.\n",
            "[06:56.640 --> 07:01.360]  And so that's what I started to do, to be able to make more money to make the works.\n",
            "[07:01.360 --> 07:05.680]  That's not a career move a lot of artists make.\n",
            "[07:05.680 --> 07:11.320]  I did it only that I could make enough money to make my vacuum cleaner pieces.\n",
            "[07:11.320 --> 07:15.900]  The vacuum cleaners he's talking about were what first got him noticed in 1980.\n",
            "[07:15.900 --> 07:21.520]  He bought about 20 brand new vacuums and displayed them in cases with fluorescent lights.\n",
            "[07:21.520 --> 07:24.040]  It was part of a series called The New.\n",
            "[07:24.040 --> 07:28.680]  I was showing them for their newness, that this was a brand new object.\n",
            "[07:28.680 --> 07:30.880]  It was never used.\n",
            "[07:30.880 --> 07:35.200]  You can see that it's clean, it's pristine, its lungs are pure.\n",
            "[07:35.200 --> 07:39.360]  And there's also some sensual aspects to it too.\n",
            "[07:39.360 --> 07:40.360]  Sensual aspects?\n",
            "[07:40.360 --> 07:44.720]  Sensual, I mean you have the handle and you have the bag right there, it could be looked\n",
            "[07:44.720 --> 07:46.200]  at as masculine.\n",
            "[07:46.200 --> 07:50.920]  Or you could look at it and say, oh, you know, the bag is the womb.\n",
            "[07:50.920 --> 07:54.000]  Art definitely is in the eye of the beholder.\n",
            "[07:54.000 --> 07:58.320]  What did you think of Jeff Coons as an artist when he first sort of came on the scene?\n",
            "[07:58.320 --> 08:02.680]  I was interested in him and I also was kind of repulsed by him.\n",
            "[08:02.680 --> 08:06.960]  Robert Stohr, former dean at the Yale School of Art, was a curator at the Museum of Modern\n",
            "[08:06.960 --> 08:11.800]  Art in New York when it acquired some of Coons' vacuums in 1996.\n",
            "[08:11.800 --> 08:16.520]  I think some of the work is really unpleasant, but it doesn't mean it's not serious.\n",
            "[08:16.520 --> 08:18.280]  What's unpleasant about it?\n",
            "[08:18.280 --> 08:20.280]  The imagery is vulgar, okay?\n",
            "[08:20.280 --> 08:22.480]  Now vulgar means many things.\n",
            "[08:22.480 --> 08:25.200]  It means of the people rather than of the elites.\n",
            "[08:25.200 --> 08:29.960]  So it's taking an object which the New York elites might look at and think, oh, that's\n",
            "[08:29.960 --> 08:30.960]  tacky.\n",
            "[08:30.960 --> 08:31.960]  That's trashy.\n",
            "[08:32.240 --> 08:34.800]  That's something you buy in a gift shop.\n",
            "[08:34.800 --> 08:40.440]  And it's blowing it up and making it perfect and saying that this has value?\n",
            "[08:40.440 --> 08:43.440]  It has meaning, not necessarily value, but it has meaning.\n",
            "[08:43.440 --> 08:44.880]  What is the message of that?\n",
            "[08:44.880 --> 08:49.600]  The message is that it is there to be embraced, that it is not to be mocked, that one should\n",

            "[09:49.600 --> 09:54.440]  First he used a CAT scan machine to digitally map every detail of the figurine inside and\n",

            "[09:55.680 --> 10:00.400]  Then it took him five years and the help of MIT scientists to begin translating all those\n",

            "[01:56.980 --> 02:01.960]  It's more than $4 billion, but it's hard to keep track when you're always on the go.\n",

            "[02:03.600 --> 02:07.840]  Before the NBA draft in New York City, we watched him work the phones.\n",

            "[02:21.560 --> 02:22.560]  Yes, sir.\n",
            "[02:22.560 --> 02:28.480]  In college, Lively was known for his defense, but Paul had him work on his three-point shot\n",
            "[02:28.480 --> 02:35.560]  and before the draft, invited teams to see. Lively shot up to the 12th pick, about ten\n",

            "[02:39.100 --> 02:45.000]  It might not look like it, but Rich Paul is a towering figure in the NBA.\n",

            "[02:51.120 --> 02:55.960]  Some of his biggest swings have been for his biggest client, LeBron James.\n",
            "[02:55.960 --> 03:04.320]  Paul negotiated his jumps from Miami to Cleveland to L.A. deals that netted James $400 million\n",
            "[03:04.320 --> 03:08.540]  and set him up to win two of his four championships.\n",

            "[03:42.080 --> 03:46.400]  That's apparently how superstar Anthony Davis felt in 2018.\n",

            "[04:06.240 --> 04:12.060]  The drama landed Paul on the cover of Sports Illustrated, which called him the most polarizing\n",

            "[04:15.220 --> 04:19.140]  When it was someone that didn't look like me, it was genius.\n",

            "[04:22.260 --> 04:25.340]  But when it's me, I'm destroying the league.\n",
            "[04:25.340 --> 04:29.100]  I mean, those things are absurd.\n",
            "[04:29.100 --> 04:36.540]  He got Davis what he wanted, a championship ring and a deal now worth $270 million.\n",

            "[06:05.660 --> 06:10.700]  When he was about four, he learned his mother Minerva was hooked on crack.\n",
            "[06:10.700 --> 06:16.420]  His father, Big Rich, recognized his son's intelligence and kept him close, though they\n",
            "[06:16.420 --> 06:18.020]  lived apart.\n",
            "[06:18.020 --> 06:20.540]  He owned the neighborhood convenience store.\n",
            "[06:20.540 --> 06:22.860]  So your dad's store was just right in here?\n",
            "[06:22.860 --> 06:25.260]  Yeah, and this was my world.\n",
            "[06:25.260 --> 06:30.140]  This now empty corner was a hotbed of activity, legal and illegal.\n",
            "[06:30.140 --> 06:33.300]  It was a shootout right here on this corner.\n",
            "[06:33.300 --> 06:37.340]  Big Rich taught his son to always think two steps ahead.\n",
            "[06:37.340 --> 06:42.420]  He scraped together the money to send him to a Catholic high school away from the neighborhood.\n",
            "[06:42.420 --> 06:45.580]  Still, there was no avoiding the streets.\n",
            "[06:45.580 --> 06:47.340]  You don't know what you're in.\n",
            "[06:47.340 --> 06:48.340]  That's your norm.\n",

            "[06:49.340 --> 06:52.060]  Sardines out the can.\n",
            "[06:52.060 --> 06:58.300]  That was today's version of tuna tartare on the Waldorf rooftop.\n",
            "[06:58.300 --> 07:00.660]  This was my education, though.\n",
            "[07:00.660 --> 07:03.940]  This was my Harvard, my Michigan, my Morehouse.\n",
            "[07:03.940 --> 07:08.460]  And the same things I learned on this corner, I take it to the boardroom.\n",
            "[07:08.460 --> 07:13.780]  Because the one thing this teaches you that I don't think you can learn from those institutions\n",
            "[07:13.780 --> 07:17.380]  is people, characters.\n",
            "[07:17.380 --> 07:22.820]  And on these streets, there's no better way to learn character because they're coming\n",

            "[07:24.180 --> 07:29.540]  His dad taught him another skill, a way to make money if all else fails, with a pair\n",

            "[07:31.100 --> 07:37.620]  Paul and his best friend, Edward Givens, were regulars at an open-air casino in the park.\n",
            "[07:37.620 --> 07:42.500]  Fifty people crowded around this little area, and the energy was high, it was an arena.\n",
            "[07:42.500 --> 07:44.860]  And Rich Paul was a natural.\n",
            "[07:44.860 --> 07:46.700]  And how much would you earn?\n",
            "[07:46.700 --> 07:50.460]  I mean, a slow day was $1,000.\n",
            "[07:50.460 --> 07:52.660]  And a not-slow day?\n",
            "[07:52.660 --> 07:53.660]  Ah!\n",
            "[07:53.660 --> 07:56.940]  You know, four or five.\n",
            "[07:56.940 --> 07:57.940]  Four or five thousand dollars.\n",
            "[07:57.940 --> 07:58.940]  Easy.\n",
            "[07:58.940 --> 07:59.940]  Easy.\n",
            "[07:59.940 --> 08:00.940]  When you were 14, 15, 16.\n",
            "[08:00.940 --> 08:01.940]  Oh, yeah.\n",
            "[08:01.940 --> 08:04.620]  But what did you learn from this experience?\n",
            "[08:04.620 --> 08:06.700]  You gain a resilience here.\n",
            "[08:06.700 --> 08:09.100]  We won majority of the time.\n",
            "[08:09.100 --> 08:11.300]  But you also had to learn how to lose.\n",
            "[08:11.300 --> 08:14.420]  He suffered his biggest loss when he was 19.\n",
            "[08:14.460 --> 08:20.980]  His father died from cancer, and Paul went all in on the streets, selling marijuana and\n",

            "[08:22.780 --> 08:26.460]  This is the very drug that your mother was hooked on.\n",
            "[08:26.460 --> 08:34.380]  The absence of my dad allowed me to take that step, because I would have never done that\n",
            "[08:34.380 --> 08:38.740]  had he been around.\n",
            "[08:38.740 --> 08:40.260]  I had too much respect for him.\n",
            "[08:40.340 --> 08:45.260]  If it was not something that I would sit here and glorify.\n",
            "[08:45.260 --> 08:48.340]  It almost sounds like you were a full-time hustler.\n",
            "[08:48.340 --> 08:49.900]  Oh, yeah.\n",
            "[08:49.900 --> 08:52.300]  But Jeff Bezos is a hustler.\n",
            "[08:52.300 --> 08:54.740]  I think he's not.\n",
            "[08:54.740 --> 08:57.340]  Phil Knight was the ultimate hustler.\n",
            "[08:57.340 --> 09:06.700]  The difference is, they could go with their plan and their business idea and get someone\n",
            "[09:06.700 --> 09:08.380]  to believe in them.\n",
            "[09:08.380 --> 09:12.940]  It didn't matter what idea I had, just no pathway to get there.\n",
            "[09:12.940 --> 09:15.380]  He found one through a stroke of luck.\n",
            "[09:15.380 --> 09:21.580]  At the Akron Canton Airport in 2001, Paul was wearing a throwback jersey like this one\n",
            "[09:21.580 --> 09:27.980]  that caught the eye of another traveler, high school hoop sensation LeBron James.\n",
            "[09:27.980 --> 09:29.180]  What did you see in him?\n",
            "[09:29.180 --> 09:34.420]  It began with him wearing a throwback jersey that I loved.\n",
            "[09:34.420 --> 09:37.660]  But as we got to talking about sports, we started evolving and even talking more and\n",
            "[09:37.900 --> 09:42.980]  more just about life and about our upbringing, about our moms and our communities and stuff\n",
            "[09:42.980 --> 09:43.980]  of that nature.\n",
            "[09:43.980 --> 09:48.900]  And it just kind of struck a chord.\n",
            "[09:48.900 --> 09:54.020]  When James entered the NBA, he hired Rich Paul as a right-hand man.\n",
            "[09:54.020 --> 09:59.100]  Paul went on to work for LeBron's agent and watched, listened and learned.\n",
            "[09:59.100 --> 10:05.620]  I understand that you would go into meetings with the likes of Warren Buffett.\n",
            "[10:05.620 --> 10:13.060]  Sitting in those rooms is much better to listen than to talk.\n",
            "[10:13.060 --> 10:19.700]  If you listen, you might actually learn something and you start to kind of, you know, work your\n",
            "[10:19.700 --> 10:22.220]  way on your own.\n",
            "[10:22.220 --> 10:28.820]  After just four years, he struck out on his own and launched Clutch Sports Group in 2012.\n",
            "[10:28.820 --> 10:31.880]  LeBron James went with him.\n",
            "[10:31.880 --> 10:35.180]  When you first started this, you were underestimated.\n",
            "[10:35.180 --> 10:40.020]  Not only was I underestimated, I was also not wanted.\n",
            "[10:40.020 --> 10:44.620]  I didn't look like the success in our industry, especially from a place of decision-making.\n",
            "[10:44.620 --> 10:46.940]  And I wanted to disrupt the industry.\n",
            "[10:46.940 --> 10:51.380]  I wanted to be impactful, but I wanted to come from a place of purpose.\n",
            "[10:51.380 --> 10:57.540]  In 2013, with his first negotiation as agent for Phoenix Suns guard Eric Bledsoe, he proved\n",
            "[10:57.540 --> 10:59.320]  the naysayers wrong.\n",
            "[10:59.320 --> 11:03.260]  He said the Suns had offered $28 million.\n",
            "[11:03.260 --> 11:04.980]  And then $48 million.\n",
            "[11:04.980 --> 11:05.980]  You turned it down?\n",

            "[11:06.980 --> 11:08.740]  Well, what was on the line?\n",

            "[11:10.940 --> 11:16.700]  Everyone was calling and saying, he's crazy, he doesn't know what he's doing, he's inexperienced.\n",
            "[11:16.700 --> 11:22.060]  It sounds like you are really comfortable rolling the dice.\n",
            "[11:22.060 --> 11:24.020]  I was born a dice roller.\n",
            "[11:24.020 --> 11:25.980]  His gamble paid off.\n",
            "[11:25.980 --> 11:32.780]  After hanging tough for a year, Clutch got Bledsoe a $70 million deal, $42 million more\n",
            "[11:32.820 --> 11:35.340]  than the Suns' first offer.\n",
            "[11:35.340 --> 11:36.340]  Great room.\n",
            "[11:36.340 --> 11:42.540]  Today, Clutch has 70 employees with offices in Los Angeles, New York, and Atlanta.\n",
            "[11:42.540 --> 11:44.980]  They both in the same draft class.\n",

            "[07:45.740 --> 07:50.020]  To break us.\n",
            "[07:50.020 --> 07:55.580]  And by choosing civilian targets, Putin wanted to achieve exactly this.\n",

            "[07:57.220 --> 08:04.380]  This person who has made his way with such bloody actions, with everything he has said,\n",
            "[08:04.380 --> 08:06.300]  cannot be trusted.\n",
            "[08:06.300 --> 08:13.340]  There is no trust in such a person because he has not been a human being for a long time.\n",

            "[09:41.380 --> 09:47.860]  We first met Zelensky not long after the invasion when his office was a blacked out bunker.\n",
            "[09:47.860 --> 09:52.940]  Now, a year and a half later, we noticed a difference.\n",
            "[09:52.940 --> 10:00.000]  As we were setting up the interview, the former actor used his talent to mask the strain.\n",

            "[10:03.980 --> 10:10.500]  And then instantly he seemed pulled beneath a depth no one can know.\n",
            "[10:10.500 --> 10:12.700]  We don't know what he was thinking.\n",
            "[10:12.700 --> 10:24.500]  It looked like empathy for the lost and for those who might be saved.\n",

            "[10:53.420 --> 10:58.220]  You are the president, but it must be humbling to meet those men.\n",
            "[10:58.220 --> 11:05.220]  I wonder what they mean to you.\n",
            "[11:05.220 --> 11:07.420]  First of all, it's a great honor for me.\n",
            "[11:07.420 --> 11:12.940]  I look into their eyes and it makes me proud that we have such strong people, because this\n",
            "[11:12.940 --> 11:16.160]  is a big risk, a big risk.\n",
            "[11:16.160 --> 11:20.860]  You can definitely lose your life for the sake of saving other lives.\n",
            "[11:20.860 --> 11:25.740]  And when I say other lives, I don't speak in general, I mean my own life, the lives\n",

            "[11:27.580 --> 11:32.860]  And I understand completely what risks are involved.\n",
            "[11:33.500 --> 11:40.500]  But empathy for life has Volodymyr Zelensky reaching out again to the United Nations and\n",
            "[11:40.500 --> 11:47.700]  the United States, hoping to convince the Allies that the world can be safe only when\n",
            "[11:47.700 --> 11:50.180]  Ukraine is whole.\n",
            "[11:50.180 --> 11:55.500]  Can you give up any part of Ukraine for peace?\n",

            "[12:02.820 --> 12:13.820]  Today, you and I, you said it to me, you saw me awarding people medals.\n",
            "[12:13.820 --> 12:16.140]  Today is a day like that.\n",
            "[12:16.140 --> 12:20.700]  A week ago, I gave awards to parents of soldiers who have been killed.\n",
            "[12:20.700 --> 12:23.620]  There were 24 families of the dead.\n",
            "[12:23.620 --> 12:26.740]  There was a woman, she was with three children.\n",
            "[12:26.740 --> 12:33.420]  There were parents, very old, they could barely walk and they had had only one son.\n",
            "[12:33.420 --> 12:35.260]  One of the women was pregnant.\n",
            "[12:35.260 --> 12:39.540]  She arrived holding a baby in her arms and she was pregnant.\n",
            "[12:39.540 --> 12:42.500]  And that baby will never see.\n",
            "[12:42.500 --> 12:44.260]  What should I tell them?\n",
            "[12:44.260 --> 12:54.340]  That all of them died so that we could say, it's okay, Russia, you can take it all.\n",
            "[12:54.340 --> 12:55.940]  It's a difficult job.\n",

            "[03:16.800 --> 03:22.040]  We went to Rapid City, South Dakota, a side pocket of America, to Van Boening's pool hall,\n",
            "[03:22.040 --> 03:27.720]  where he explained that making balls disappear into pockets is only half of pool excellence.\n",
            "[03:27.720 --> 03:32.680]  It's also about setting up your next shots, cue ball control, they call it.\n",
            "[03:32.680 --> 03:39.920]  And I'm going to make the cue ball stop right here, so I can shoot the two on the side.\n",
            "[03:40.880 --> 03:43.520]  You did that how?\n",

            "[03:44.880 --> 03:46.720]  Just hit it right below center.\n",
            "[03:46.720 --> 03:49.240]  So now it lines up that next ball perfectly.\n",
            "[03:49.240 --> 03:50.240]  Yeah.\n",
            "[03:50.240 --> 03:53.320]  I'm so struck by the geometry of all this.\n",
            "[03:53.320 --> 03:55.280]  Yeah, I love geometry.\n",
            "[03:55.280 --> 03:57.480]  It's all about the angles.\n",
            "[03:57.480 --> 04:02.800]  Van Boening says he can see every angle on the table, a sixth sense that comes from practicing\n",
            "[04:02.800 --> 04:07.040]  as much as 10 hours a day, shooting half a million balls a year.\n",
            "[04:07.040 --> 04:08.640]  I want to make the shot perfect.\n",
            "[04:09.040 --> 04:13.400]  The only way to hit it perfect, you got to do it over and over and over.\n",
            "[04:13.400 --> 04:16.080]  Can you be perfect in this sport?\n",
            "[04:16.080 --> 04:18.120]  No.\n",
            "[04:18.120 --> 04:21.160]  I tried so hard all these years.\n",
            "[04:21.160 --> 04:23.160]  Van Boening comes by it honestly.\n",
            "[04:23.160 --> 04:28.840]  His grandfather, Gary Bloomberg, a known trick shot artist, opened pool halls off by 90.\n",
            "[04:28.840 --> 04:32.400]  Easy access for hustlers passing across the Great Plains.\n",
            "[04:32.400 --> 04:35.400]  But these rooms were family-friendly places.\n",
            "[04:35.440 --> 04:40.400]  So much so, Shane got his first pool cue when he was two and went to the pool room every\n",
            "[04:40.400 --> 04:42.080]  day after school.\n",
            "[04:42.080 --> 04:45.840]  Not just to play, but to escape kids who picked on him for being deaf.\n",
            "[04:45.840 --> 04:46.840]  How bad did it get?\n",
            "[04:46.840 --> 04:50.800]  The kid would start throwing rocks at me.\n",
            "[04:50.800 --> 04:52.960]  They would put gum in my hair.\n",
            "[04:52.960 --> 04:57.960]  And then I would go home to my mom and I'd be going home crying, you know.\n",
            "[04:57.960 --> 05:03.000]  And then she made me feel better by asking me, do you want to go to the pool?\n",
            "[05:03.000 --> 05:05.480]  Why did coming to the pool room make you feel better?\n",
            "[05:05.480 --> 05:08.800]  You know, when you walk in the pool room, what do you see?\n",
            "[05:08.800 --> 05:12.280]  You know, you see people having a good time.\n",
            "[05:12.280 --> 05:13.640]  But it was more than that.\n",
            "[05:13.640 --> 05:18.000]  He had prodigious ability for thinking multiple strokes ahead.\n",
            "[05:18.000 --> 05:20.520]  When Van Boening was 18, he hit the road.\n",
            "[05:20.520 --> 05:24.640]  He and his uncle loaded into an RV looking for money games.\n",
            "[05:24.640 --> 05:26.120]  Came to play pool, pats.\n",
            "[05:26.120 --> 05:27.360]  Of course they did.\n",
            "[05:27.360 --> 05:32.600]  The hustler, that stealth road man armed only with a wooden stick and confidence, divorcing\n",
            "[05:32.600 --> 05:38.880]  the locals from their cash, has been romanticized for decades, not least by Paul Newman.\n",
            "[05:38.880 --> 05:43.340]  This reporter was so taken by pool hustling, he once wrote a book about it.\n",
            "[05:43.340 --> 05:46.240]  For Van Boening, the romance hit the rocks abruptly.\n",
            "[05:46.240 --> 05:52.320]  Yeah, I actually was playing in the pool in Tennessee and I was playing this guy for money\n",
            "[05:52.320 --> 05:57.920]  and we were playing for a whole lot and he was losing and he picked up the key ball and\n",
            "[05:57.920 --> 05:58.920]  threw it at me.\n",
            "[05:58.920 --> 05:59.920]  Where'd he hit you?\n",
            "[05:59.920 --> 06:01.200]  He hit me right on the chest.\n",
